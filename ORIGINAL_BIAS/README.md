### Oh bias, what did I do?
The original bias implementation used here is probably wrong, but it worked fine _(sort of)_ back in January 2021 with the original release of [TBVGG3_SGD.h](TBVGG3_SGD.h) and [TBVGG3_NAG.h](TBVGG3_NAG.h) so I'm keeping it around as a spectacle of guesswork.

[TBVGG3_ADA8](../TBVGG3_ADA8.h) or [TBVGG3_ADA16](../TBVGG3_ADA16.h) are the preferred implementations of Bias.
